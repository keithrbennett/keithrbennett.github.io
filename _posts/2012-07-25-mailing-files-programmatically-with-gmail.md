Recently I had the need to send someone multiple 1-2 MB files. Email was the best option, for reasons that are not very interesting, and outside the scope of this article.

I naturally turned to my favorite language, Ruby.Â  I did a little research into the various gems and their configuration, and offer this simple example (source code below) in the hope that it will save you a little time if you have the same need.

I&#8217;ve tried to trim out anything not relating to the actual sending of the mail so that you can more easily understand it and adapt it for your use.
