See instructions at https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme for 
how to use a remote theme.

Cannot get any theme other than the default to work. Reverted to minima theme.

Added:

plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-remote-theme    <--
  
Didn't work:

#remote_theme: benbalter/retlab
#remote_theme: fongandrew/hydeout
#theme: retlab
